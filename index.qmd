I am Keith, an undergraduate student at the Singapore Institute of Technology, studying the **Bachelor of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence**. I am interested in the field of *AI and machine learning*, as well as *data science and data analysis*, and I am currently learning R and other languages to improve my skills in these areas.
<br>
<br>
I love taking on challenging tasks that makes me think.
*Machine Learning and Deep Learning* are the key focus in my journey within information technology. 
I strive to gain more skills and knowledge and become a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
